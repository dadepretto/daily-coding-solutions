# Day 19

A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different
colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring
houses are of the same color.

Given an N by K matrix where the n<sup>th</sup> row and k<sup>th</sup> column
represents the cost to build the n<sup>th</sup> house with k<sup>th</sup> color,
return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.
